Tune Generator creates a melody and chordal accompaniment at random in a 32-bar form and can be used for live set performance. 

## Installation and Setup:

Uses the Python libraries SCAMP and music21. Type the following commands in the command prompt to install: 

pip install scamp music21 pynput python-rtmidi

Requires a music XML reader. Music notation software such as Sibelius, Finale, or MuseScore work fine. MuseScore is free and recommended: https://musescore.org/en/download

## Run the app:

Download all files to same directory, open generator.py, configure file path, run generator.py, and configure input for music21 library using configure.run() command (only needs to be ran once and can be removed after setup is complete), set MuseScore or other notation software to open XML file.
